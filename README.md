# Sum_of_3_Palindromes
Let *g >= 5* be a positive integer, Any positive number(n) can be written as a sum of three palindromes in base *g*.

### Reserch Paper
The [Reserch Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06208) by *Javier Cilleruelo*, *Florian Luca* and *Lewis Baxter* says that - 
***"Every positive integer is a sum of three palindromes"***

### Requirements to Execute code
- python v3.7

### Requirements to Understand code
- python v3.7
- [Reserch Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06208)
- PDF Reader to read Reserch Paper
- Text Editor(PyCharm if possible)

### Execution Process
- If possible use PyCharm but terminal(console) also works
- Put all .py files in a folder(Directory)
- Execute *main.py* file
- Insert data (Input)
  - Enter number(n)
    - Number's(n's) digits must be seperated by space so, *'27182'* is wrong but *'2 7 1 8 2'* is correct in base 10.
    - if Base is *g* then valid digits are *0* to *g-1* in decimal form so, in base *16* system the valid digits are *0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15* and *'1 4 14 11 8 15'* is valid number(n)
  - Enter Base
    - Base must be positive integer and *>= 5*
- There are four lists in output
  - First list is inputed number.
  - Another three lists are three palindrome numbers in base *g* and sum of these three palindroms is inputed number
  - Here, all lists's elements are digits of that number
