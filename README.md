# Sum_of_3_Palindromes
Let g >= 5 be a positive integer, Any positive number can be written as a sum of three palindromes in base g.

### Reserch Paper
The [Reserch Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06208) by *Javier Cilleruelo*, *Florian Luca* and *Lewis Baxter* says that - 
***"Every positive integer is a sum of three palindromes"***

### Requirements to Execute code
- python v3.7

### Requirements to Understand code
- python v3.7
- [Reserch Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06208)
- PDF Reader to read Reserch Paper
- Text Editor(PyCharm if possible)

### Execution Process
- Put all .py files in a folder.
- Execute main.py file
- Insert data (Input)
  - Enter number
    - Number's digits must be seperated by space so, '27182' is wrong but '2 7 1 8 2' is correct in base 10.
    - if Base is *g* then valid digits are *0* to *g-1* in decimal form so, in base 16 system the valid digits are *0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15* and '1 4 14 11 8 15' cam be valid number
  - Enter Base
    - Base must be positive integer and >= 5.
